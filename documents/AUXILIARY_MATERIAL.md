The dispersion model [AUSTAL](https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en/topics/air/air-quality-control-in-europe/overview) is the reference implementation to Annex 2 of the German Environment Agencyâ€™s Technical Instructions on Air Quality Control (TA Luft) and implements the specifications and requirements given therein.

The program is the successor of AUSTAL2000 (which was previously used with Open-ALAQS), the reference implementation to Annex 3 of the TA Luft 2002. AUSTAL and AUSTAL2000 were developed by Janicke Consulting on behalf of the German Environment Agency and are freely available and widely used internationally.

AUSTAL 3.3.0 (released on 22.03.2024) has been developed and tested under Windows and Linux. It is exclusively provided, free of charge under the GNU Public Licence, from the dedicated webpage
of the German Environment Agency.

No installation is needed for use with Open-ALAQS as the executables are already included in the Open-ALAQS package.
