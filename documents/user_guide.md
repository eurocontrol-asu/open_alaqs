## Introduction
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

Welcome to the **Open-ALAQS** user guide. This document will help you navigate the key features of the software, including setting up a study, emissions & dispersion calculations and exporting results in various formats.

### General Information
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

Open-ALAQS is a [EUROCONTROL](https://www.eurocontrol.int/) open-source tool designed to model and analyze emissions from aircraft operations and various airport sources. It can calculate emission inventories, visualize data, and perform dispersion modeling with the help of [AUSTAL](https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en/topics/air/air-quality-control-in-europe/overview).

It is developed as a plugin for the open-source geographic information system [QGIS](https://qgis.org/), simplifying the definition of various airport elements (such as runways, taxiways, and buildings) and enabling the visualization of the spatial distribution of emissions and concentrations. It is fully based on an open architecture, making it easily adaptable to other GIS platforms and databases.

### Installation
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

For installation instructions, check the [Installation Instructions](../README.md#installation).

## The Open-ALAQS Toolbar
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

The toolbar consists of the following functions:

- **About**: General information about the current Open-ALAQS version.
- **Create Study**: Create a new Open-ALAQS project.
- **Open Study**: Open an existing Open-ALAQS project.
- **Close Study**: Close the current project.
- **Study Setup**: Contains general information about the study.
- **Import OSM Data**: Download and import data from OpenStreetMap (OSM).
- **Profile Editor**: Create activity profiles (hourly, daily, monthly).
- **Routes Editor**: Create taxi routes based on user-defined airport elements (gates, runways, taxiways).
- **Generate Emission Inventory**: Prepares the Open-ALAQS output file containing all study data.
- **Visualize Emissions Calculation**: Manages the emissions calculation, visualization, and export modules.
- **Calculate Dispersion**: Handles the dispersion calculation module.
- **Review Logs**: Opens the log file containing useful information about code execution.

The order of the toolbar buttons generally follows the sequence of steps needed to conduct a study using Open-ALAQS.

## AUSTAL
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

The dispersion model [AUSTAL](https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en/topics/air/air-quality-control-in-europe/overview) is the reference implementation to Annex 2 of the German Environment Agencyâ€™s Technical Instructions on Air Quality Control (TA Luft) and implements the specifications and requirements given therein.

The program is the successor of AUSTAL2000 (which was previously used with Open-ALAQS), the reference implementation to Annex 3 of the TA Luft 2002. AUSTAL and AUSTAL2000 were developed by Janicke Consulting on behalf of the German Environment Agency and are freely available and widely used internationally.

AUSTAL 3.3.0 (released on 22.03.2024) has been developed and tested under Windows and Linux. It is exclusively provided, free of charge under the GNU Public Licence, from the dedicated webpage
of the German Environment Agency.

No installation is needed for use with Open-ALAQS as the executables are already included in the Open-ALAQS package.
